Data for Software Carpentry

This repository was created as part of the Software Carpentry Shell, git, and Python online class held April 27 and 28, 2021 for the U.S. Geological Survey. 
The files here were created purely for the purposes of learning how to use Anaconda, Jupyter Lab, Python, Bash Unix shell, and Git Hub.
